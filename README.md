# Course Sequencer

## What this is

I don't really like [Course Plan](courseplan.io), so I'm trying to make my own.
I also wanted to jump back into functional programming, so I'm using Elm, which
so far has been a good decision: so many things just work!

## Setup

Data files can be generated by running the `download-omnibus.py` script and the
`simplify.py` script; `simplified.json` is the actual data file used by the frontend.

`index.html` is the front end; `main.js` can be generated using `elm make src/Main.elm --out=main.js`

I did not write the CSS, ChatGPT did.

## Goals

 - [ ] Prerequisite tracking
 - [ ] Customizable requirements
 - [ ] (Good) tracking of distribution requirements
 - [x] Drag-and-drop UI
